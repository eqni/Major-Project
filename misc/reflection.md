# Major Project Reflection

### Did I complete all my Needs to have?
Yes

### Hardest part
The potting mechanic was the hardest part to code. Overall, it was something I had to figure out step by step before implementation.
Potting involved modifying mouse controls, scanning for blocks, etc. To add it, I converted my grid to txt files and standardized my cells. As a result, it was the hardest part.

### Problems I couldn't solve
File Iteration for loading sound effects

### Advice if I were to do it again
- Use a game engine to save time.
- First finish the game before optimizing it.
- Don't use JS, since I'm more proficient in other languages that are better suited for game creation.
##### Conclusion: my project turned out alright, and my process went smoothly too. However, I spent too much time optimizing my code. As a result, the game's content can be explored to its completion within minutes.
##### If I had another opportunity to create a Major Project, my main priority would be to implement substantial gameplay. However, overall I'm satisfied with my game.
